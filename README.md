# Business-Analyst-Job-Posting-Description-Analysis-Text-Analysis_Topic-Model

In this project, we scraped business analyst positions in San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Mountain View at 2018/12/2 as our dataset for text analysis.

To gain insights from these postings, this analysis includes exploratory data analysis and visualization, TF-IDF (Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency) analysis, and topic model.

This project is for academic purpose and is a group work for class 'Collecting and Analyzing Large Datasets' in UCSD MS Business Analytics.
